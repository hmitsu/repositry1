# app-ci YAML pipeline
# We are setting up a pipeline resource that references the security-lib-ci
# pipeline and setting up a pipeline completion trigger so that our app-ci
# pipeline runs when a run of the security-lib-ci pipeline completes
trigger: none

resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: pipeline-b # Name of the pipeline resource.
    source: pipeline-a # The name of the pipeline referenced by this pipeline resource.
    project: repositry1 # Required only if the source pipeline is in another project
    trigger: true # Run app-ci pipeline when any run of security-lib-ci completes

steps:
- bash: echo "pipeline-b runs after pipeline-a completes"
